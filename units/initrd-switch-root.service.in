# Just before switching to the new rootfs, systemd might send us a TERM signal
# depending on how fast we are to execute the main command and exit. If we get
# the SIGTERM signal that simply means that we succeed but haven't got enough
# time to exit properly. Since systemd considers SIGTERM as a failure for
# short-running process (aka Type=oneshot), instruct it to ignore this case.
